# Homelab
The aim of this repo Is to be a living design document for my homelab.

To document the conceptual and logical design and how that maps to the physical design.

This has taken inspiration from Christain Mohn amongst others. `http://vninja.net/homelab/'

It's also practice for writing in markdown as well aswell as documenting "enterprise like architecture"
